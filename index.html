                        <p>Hello world! We are team Errol from Software University of Sofia, Bulgaria. This webpage is our teamwork assignment. Our main goal was to design and implement a funny Web site about SoftUni using HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
                        <p>The web page is divided in three categories: News, Gallery, Meet the Staff. Everything here is for educational purposes only. The similarity with real people is pure coincidence. We don’t take responsibility for anything.</p>

                        <p> -The first message ever relayed over the internet was “LOG which was actually supposed to have been “LOGIN” but there was a huge crash and this difficult task couldn’t be completed for the time being. This was back in the 1960’s at the famous research university known as MIT.</p>
                        <p> -Over 75% of all email messages are considered total spam.It’s estimated that only about 6% of these annoying messages are actually opened. Hopefully it’s not a virus!</p>
                        <p> -About 15 hours of video are uploaded to Youtube from around the globe each minute.After reading about this, I now know why the site typically has a limit of 10 minutes per video.</p>
                        <p> -The first internet banner ad was launched in 1994 and it ended up being a huge hit because people just couldn’t resist clicking. It looks like an older ad, but the same strategies are used by advertisers today.</p>
                        <p> -About 1/3 of all internet searches are for pornography.Experts have done special research on the topic and estimate that at least 65% of all pictures on the internet are of naked women. In addition, about 28,000 internet users are watching X rated videos at any given time.</p>
